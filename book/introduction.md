# Callysto

Callysto is a Rust framework for stream processing, which benefits from Rustâ€™s concurrency model and optimized performance.
It is made for writing distributed services at any scale, don't be tricked by the name of the framework, Callysto is basically for building services in a fault-tolerant way too.
It contains necessary primitives to build self-healing services.

Callysto made available with Kafka Streams mentality in Rust. It is for building high-performance distributed system and near real-time data pipelines to process large amounts of events.

Callysto behaves like both stream processing and event processing framework, sharing similarity with tools such as Faust, Kafka Streams, Apache Spark/Storm/Samza/Flink.

It is built on service oriented model to build microservices.
