//!
//! Callysto is a Rust framework for stream processing,
//! which benefits from Rust's concurrency model and
//! optimized performance.
//!
//! Callysto made available with Kafka Streams mentality in Rust.
//! It is for building high-performance distributed system and near real-time data
//! pipelines to process large amounts of events.
//!
//! Callysto behaves like both stream processing and event processing,
//! sharing similarity with tools such as Faust, Kafka Streams, Apache Spark/Storm/Samza/Flink.
//!
//! It is built on service oriented model to build microservices.
