### Requirements
* cmake
* clang

### Rust MSRV
We are using:
```
rustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)
```

### Running
#### With Docker Compose - Nerdctl Compose 
1. You need to have docker installation locally.
With containerd backend, if you want to bring single node Kafka replacement use:
```shell
$ nerdctl compose up
```
If you want to bring Confluent Kafka single node. You can:
```shell
$ nerdctl compose -f docker-compose.kafkasn.yml
```
If you want to bring full blown Confluent Kafka cluster. Use:
```shell
$ nerdctl compose -f docker-compose.kafkacluster.yml
```

Mind that `nerdctl` command is interchangeable with `docker`.

#### With K8S
1. You need to have K8S installation locally.
```shell
$ cd k8s && kubectl apply -f . && kubectl port-forward svc/redpanda 9092:9092
```

3. Now you can run the producers in Python.
```shell
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ which pip3 # check that it is pointing to venv
$ pip3 install aiokafka -U
$ python examples/producer.py
```

3. Now you can spawn the double agent example (without durability).
```shell
$ RUST_LOG="info,rdkafka::client=warn" RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --example double-agent
```

Environment variables passed above is optional, but suggested for development.
